When the vehicle was returned, the rear view camera did not function (black screen and/or serious flicker when video was partially displayed). Also bubbles were introduced into the front display panel.  On questioning the repair, I was strongly encouraged by technician and then by manager to get an updated ""infotainment with an upgraded MCU"" (which is unclear but perhaps a superset of the VCM and display components that are under recall), for a cost of $2000 and $500 for it to include FM radio (that I already have and always worked fine). The manager offered a deal for $1000 + $500 to include FM radio. An appointment was set up and the estimate for approval was $1500 for ""infotainment upgrade"" and $500 for ""Radio upgrade"", and $120 taxes for a total of $2120.00  I will cancel the upgrade and inquire again if the recall work is able to return the vehicle in working order without it needing a $2000 upgrade to resolve an issue related to loss of viability and backup camera (cited under the recall) and to charge me $500 for an FM radio I already have that works fine.",Vehicle,2012,TESLA,MODEL S

Am told by a Tesla tech that this issue is related to outdated MCU1 hardware and that a 1500 upgrade to MCU2 hardware will resolve the issue.  The current software that runs on 9 year old hardware (same chips are used from 2012-early 2018) is too bloated and causes usability issues that create unsafe driving conditions. It is imperative that speed, climate control and other functions that MCU handles have 100% uptime, especially when the vehicle is in motion.   This is only possible by a hardware upgrade that can run Tesla’s latest software (which is automatically pushed several times per year).  Right now, Tesla will sell customers an upgraded MCU for $1500-2000, depending on vehicle.  This MCU can handle the latest software that inevitably finds its way to every Tesla vehicle through automatic updates.  Customers should not have to pay $2000 to maintain basic features, such as timely vehicle power up, reliable speedometer and climate controls, and consistently performing music playing.  I have had dozens of issues with MCU performance over the 5year ownership period.   NHTSA should do a performance and reliability evaluation of a model S or X with MCU 1 vs MCU 2 and use this data as evidence to demand Tesla recall for all 2018 and earlier vehicles with MCU 1.  Common issues include:  1. Waiting 30-90 seconds for vehicle to power up and become drivable. This is especially concerning when driver needs to move vehicle in a timely fashion (think of scenario with impending danger). 2. Either of 2 screens going blank for 2-30 minutes, including while driving. This creates anxiety and distraction for a driver loosing gauges and loss of vehicle controls 3.

The topic has been brought up on Tesla forums numerous times and countless drivers are experiencing the same issue due to faulty parts provided during the manufacture of Tesla vehicles.  The issue causes turning tightness, tire rubbing, and complete car driving capability failure, usually at low speeds.  With the frequency of the complaint and the potential danger it could cause should the front suspension fully fail at higher speeds, this serious matter needs to be investigated on an urgent basis. As older Tesla vehicles are now aging the occurrence and increased risk is only rising to everyday, unsuspecting drivers.  Just recently, my fore link and front suspension failed only minorly, and without and complete understanding of what the issue was the car was experiencing I continued to drive the vehicle. The only noticeable issue that came up for me was tire rubbing during reversing and slight misalignment when the vehicle was parked.  After taking it in to Tesla I now know that this could have been a fatal error on my part of the front suspension would have failed completely during highway speeds.  When these front fore links fail, most will only experience minor issues like me and avoid taking it into repair, as the average car buyer does not understand that this could be a catastrophic failure.  If this issue is not resolved and a recall seriously considered, I’m concerned in the not so distant future that this may lead to serious bodily harm if full failure of the front suspension occurs during highway or roadway speeds.

THIS DARTINESS BECAME WORSE AND WORSE OVER TIME, AND ALSO WAS WORSE WHEN ACCELERATING OR DECELERATING.  WE FIRST ALERTED THE DEALER OF THE PROBLEM IN AUG 2019, AND THEY REPLACED FEW COMPONENTS IN THE FRONT SUSPENSION (BOTH UPPER CONTROL ARMS AND THE RIGHT FORELINK) AND CHARGED US $1571+TAX FOR PARTS AND LABOR.     THE STEERING SEEMED A LITTLE BETTER FOR A WHILE, BUT IN JAN 2020 WE BROUGHT THE CAR BACK IN WITH CONCERNS ABOUT VAGUE STEERING AND THE DEALER RECOMMENDED A WHEEL ALIGNMENT, WHICH WE PAID FOR.  THE ALIGNMENT YIELDED NO IMPROVEMENT AND THE CAR BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY, REQUIRING CONSTANT STEERING ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP IN ITS LANE.    WE BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER IN MAY 2020, AND BY THIS TIME THE DEALER VERBALLY AGREED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IN ITS CURRENT STATE.  THEY REPLACED BOTH REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLIES AND CHARGED US $1382+TAX, BUT THIS STILL DID NOT RESOLVE THE DARTINESS.    WE RETURNED TO THE DEALER LATER IN MAY 2020, AND THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACING NEARLY EVERY OTHER SUSPENSION PART, INCLUDING BOTH REAR TOE LINKS, BOTH REAR UPPER LINKS, BOTH FRONT AFT LINKS, THE FRONT FORE LINK THAT WASN'T PREVIOUSLY REPLACED.   THE COST FOR THIS WAS A $1870+TAX.    FORTUNATELY, THE STEERING ISSUES DID NOT RESULT IN ANY ACCIDENTS.  SINCE THIS LAST REPAIR, THE CAR NOW DRIVES RELATIVELY NORMALLY FOR A 7 1/2 YEAR OLD CAR.

ON OR ABOUT 2015 I HAD COMPLAINED TO THE SERVICE DEPT. THAT I THOUGHT I HAD A CRACKED SCREEN. THE COST OF REPAIR WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY..OK, I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE WITH A COSMETIC PROBLEM BUT IT WAS NOT COSMETIC. OVER THE PAST 2 WEEKS, WHEN I PLACE MY HAND IN THE SMALL STORAGE AREA BELOW THE SCREEN, I FOUND A VERY STICKY LIQUID ON MY HAND. IT WAS FLUID LEAKING FROM THE SCREEN WHICH I WAS TOLD NOT TO TOUCH BECAUSE THAT LIQUID IS CONSIDERED A CARCINOGEN. I AM UNABLE TO USE THIS CAR FOR FEAR I WILL BE STUCK FAR AWAY FROM HOME AND REQUIRE ANOTHER TOW. I VISITED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN DEDHAM, MA AND THEY WERE UNSURE WHICH SCREEN MATCHES MY VEHICLE. THE ESTIMATED COST FOR THE SCREEN AND THE MCU WOULD BE APPROX. $2600 INCL LABOR. NO ONE WAS AVAILABLE TO OFFER ME A DEFINITIVE COST. I WAS TOLD THE WARRANTY FOR THE REPLACEMENT WOULD BE 1 YEAR. PERHAPS WITHIN 2 YEARS I WILL AGAIN HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER 2600 FOR LIQUID LEAKING FROM THE SCREEN. PLEASE HOLD TESLA ACCOUNTABLE.

IT CAN BE SEEN IN THE OFFICIAL CRASH TEST VIDEOS THAT THE ALLOY WHEELS BREAK APART WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE THEY  SHOULD BREAK APART RATHER THAN BREACHING THE PASSENGER SAFETY CELL.  SINCE THESE WHEELS ARE FRAGILE IT IS MOST UNLIKELY THAT THE SUSPENSION BROKE BECAUSE OF A HARD IMPACT TO THE WHEEL IN THE CRASH EVENT.  IT IS FAR MORE LIKELY THAT THE SUSPENSION BREAKAGE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT RATHER THAN JUST THE RESULT OF THE CRASH IMPACT.  I BELIEVE THAT TESLA IS BEING GIVEN FAR TOO MUCH BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND THAT THESE ALL TO FREQUENT CRASHES ARE OFTEN BEING CAUSED BY MECHANICAL FAILURE OF ABSURDLY FRAGILE ALLOY SUSPENSION PARTS.

I am writing this report to describe a dramatic decrease in steering responsiveness and vehicle front-end control over my ownership of this car from new. Over about the last year, I have noticed that the steering and handling of the vehicle is not nearly as composed as it was when new. Today, the car has difficulty staying centered in the lane. This unsteadiness is especially evident at Interstate speeds (60-75mph) while the car enters a curve and experiences suspension loading. It feels loose and floaty, almost like the toe is changing while mid-corner. This results in ""hunting"" or back-and-forth steering inputs just to stay on center. Furthermore, any type of road imperfection causes dramatic bump steer.  This culminates into white-knuckled grip driving, since the car will sharply pull out of its driving line. Performance driving, long road trips, or higher-speed cruising are no longer possible with this uncertain steering. Safety is somewhat impacted and the driving and ownership experience is dramatically diminished. For example, a new driver has difficulty with this car due to the ambiguous steering.  Over the year this issue has continued, the car has been inspected exactly one dozen times, nine visits to various area Tesla Service Centers and three to reputable and performance-oriented suspension shops. They have confirmed some type of pulling but have yet to adequately resolve the issue. Across all service visits, I have requested and completed replacements of many front-end parts: solid lower control arm bushings, upper control arms, and wheel hubs. Also, a dozen alignments, few balances, and new tires. I have attempted to make an appointment with Tesla for a rack-and-pinion replacement, but they continue to serve alignment estimates and show a lack of willingness to truly troubleshoot my issue.

The car did this *multiple* times, without warning. Each incident lasted several minutes. It was alarming, and there was no way to tell what systems in the car were working (such as automatic emergency braking or cruise control), and no way to change  settings, or even know if the turn signals were working as I tried to exit the highway.  The Model 3 has only one screen where everything (including basic instruments) is displayed and most controls are accessed. When the screen freezes, we lose access to basics like speedometer, collision safety or system failure warnings or even speedometer readings, as well as control of headlights, wipers, climate control, lock / unlock, navigation, and many other essential functions. During these failures, we do not know what if any safety systems are still operating.  Typically when this problem occurs, the screen ""freezes"" while driving, without warning or any indication of trouble. The screen remains unresponsive for a lengthy period (typically minutes) until the screen goes completely black for a time, and then eventually a Tesla logo appears, followed by instruments and controls gradually being restored.  The car was delivered from the factory to my home in this state, with other obvious defects—Tesla did not permit us to test-drive it. The next night a Tesla technician saw the failure happening in real time, through Tesla's remote diagnostics. He said the car was probably not safe to drive. I asked to return the car under Tesla's satisfaction policy, and he agreed to start the refund process. Tesla refused to take the car back, and the car has continued to exhibit these failures.

There was no warning prior to the battery failure.   The driver (my wife) was trapped in the car because the electronic door latch would not open and the windows would not retract.  My wife was panicked, crying and kicking at the window.  I had to break the window to get her out.  Tesla replaced the 12V battery as an item under warranty.  They believe that I/we should have know about the manual door release to avoid breaking the window.  This manual release is unmarked and inconspicuous.  Tesla claims that the manual door release is described in the car's user manual; however, the car's user manual is electronic (no hard copy provided) and was not accessible because the car was unresponsive.  The user manual can only be accessed from the car's display screen.  There is no telephone number to call a Tesla representative and no way to access the user manual via the iPhone application.  I had no choice but to break the window.  Tesla is aware that their 12V batteries are failing prematurely and are not doing anything to prevent drivers from being trapped inside vehicles. The tow truck driver said he picked up four Tesla cars on Aug 9th for the same battery issue.  I spoke to multiple other Tesla owners and none were aware of the manual door release.  This includes one of my neighbors who received his Tesla a few months ago.  It was not explained during the delivery process.  The driver must rely on an electronic user's manual that can only be accessed when the car is operational.  The faulty battery creates a condition that renders the car non-operational, so the contents of the user manual are irrelevant.

B) THE CAR THEN WENT IN SOME SHUTDOWN MODE OF DISPLAY, BOTH CONFUSING ME AND LEAVING ADRIFT AS TO HOW TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.    IT TOOK BOTH MY WIFE AND ME SOME HEROIC EFFORT TO DRIVE AVOIDING ANY ACCIDENT UNTIL THE CAR RECOVERED (IT WAS A PERIOD OF ~30 SEC WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ETERNITY FOR US) FROM THIS FREEZE, SHUTDOWN, AND REBOOT.

In regard to the 2nd recall, they said that they will fix it up with a recent update. No further action needed.  My concern and current complaint is my back left/driver's side quarter/corner glass shattered spontaneously.  This is after I closed the trunk and pushed back the backseat upright (which was pushed down probably from closing the trunk).  Within 30-60 seconds of being in the car, the whole class corner panel shattered.  The car was parked (in 50* degree weather) for 4 hours while I had dinner and watched a movie.  I was inside the car when the spontaneous shattering occurred on 05/10/2022 @ approximately 9:00pm.

This is unacceptable to have defective and poor quality controlled glass/workmanship.

I am lucky that I had no one in the car and the vehicle wasn't moving but I can't imagine if others would be so lucky.  I called roadside and customer service.  They were of no help.

The first issue is in regard to the delayed display of video on the screen compared to reality. The display always is delayed by a noticeable margin. Reacting to what is on the screen _now_ is often the wrong reaction, as the real position of the car has changed from what is displayed. While this delay still results in a smooth video an estimated 80% of the time, there are times when the screen freezes for a second or two, making it more likely for an accidental crash due to non-current video being displayed.  The second issue is in regard to the quality of the video displayed on the screen in what Tesla calls ""low light"" conditions. The video is grainy, with vertical lines obfuscating what is displayed on the screen. After numerous reports of this to Tesla over the time of my ownership, the always reply saying it is normal. If backing up in nighttime conditions, the screen may not adequately display surroundings due to Tesla's known inability to fix the display when it is not daylight. As reference, this happens even backing into my own garage during the daytime hours, when I can see perfectly well myself. I would not consider this low light condition.  Tesla has refused to fix this issue, and instead insists it is expected behavior and offered to explain it to me further, rather than resolving the issue.

Not only does it take 5-10 seconds to turn on the defroster which could be deadly in the event of a quickly fogging windshield, but one has to then take their eyes off the road to adjust all of the other climate functions that come on automatically by simply activating the defrost, such as a/c, seat heaters, etc. There is also no fan speed control to defrost, so on a very cold day if one does not want the defrost blowing at full power (very loud) the entire time they are driving they must keep toggling the touch button on and off, each instance requiring 2-4 clicks/swipes and 5-10 seconds of taking eyes off the road.",Vehicle,2019,TESLA,MODEL 3

Problem occurs while operating the car with Autopilot engaged such that the adaptive cruise control is in operation. Problem happens with or without also having the auto-steer function engaged. Problem is that the vehicle will suddenly, very unexpectedly slam on the brakes. This can cause the driver of the vehicle to go into panic mode and for obvious reasons is also very dangerous for vehicles that are following the malfunctioning Tesla. Sometimes, this sudden, hard braking occurs when a vehicle coming toward the Tesla makes a left turn in front of the Tesla at a VERY far away and VERY safe distance - so safe that the driver of the Tesla is caught completely off guard when the Tesla decides to slam on the brakes. And cars behind the Tesla are also caught off guard.  Other times, this ""phantom braking"" happens for no apparent reason at all - totally out of the blue. I am now very leery to use the autopilot feature, even though that was one of the vehicles biggest selling points. I am positive that only reason I have not been rear-ended is I have quick enough reflexes that I have been able to push my foot on the accelerator quickly enough to over-ride the sudden braking before the car behind me hit me. I have called Tesla's service department about this issue. They do acknowledge the issue, although in a vague manner as if they are reluctant to fully admit how prevalent and serious the issue is. I've asked if there are any adjustments I can make to the various settings that might reduce this problem.

The system will even continue to brake, after the turning vehicle has fully cleared the road. This requires the driver to slam the accelerator to cancel the braking action.  When I first purchased the vehicle in February of 2020, there were no issues with Phantom braking. This issue has become worse with over-the-air updates. I canceled my full-self driving subscription because the phantom braking was even worse with that software.  Additionally, Tesla uses a driver safety score to determine insurance rates if you are using their branded insurance program. When these phantom braking events occur it sometimes registers as an emergency braking event which deducts from your overall score and can ultimately cause your rates to increase.

The blind spot camera performance on your vehicle is neither a defect of materials nor workmanship. It is a characteristic of the product.

(1) Braking: When driving on a highway and going by an on-ramp on the right side, without any warning, the vehicle would, al of a sudden, slam violently on the brakes, even though the cars entering the highway are nowhere near where I would be driving. This has happened repeatedly to me, creating a hazard of a rear-end collision.

They have been unable or unwilling  to give us an answer. In fact, they have not been responding to text messages with the service. They are unwilling to give me a date when this might be fixed. It would be extremely dangerous for us to start the trip in the Tesla Y without any cabin heat/defrosting ability.

The regenerative brakes cause the car to suddenly brake in snow or ice.  If you brake suddenly in snow in a normal car, you may swerve, and this swerving is worse if the car is turned slightly. A friend swerved suddenly going downhill in WA in a snow storm. He recovered by lightly touching the accelerator.  My Tesla Y spun 90 degrees when I took foot off accelerator in snowstorm in RI and I was able to recover. Minutes later on expressway at 25 mph, I took foot off accelerator and the car spun 180 degrees and hit a guard rail.  In the Chevy Bolt owners manual, under winter driving, the first bullet point they make is to put the car in D--which turns off regenerative braking.  You can reduce the amount of regenerative braking on a Tesla, but you can not turn it off.  Under driving in winter on the Tesla on the website, there is no mention of reducing the regenerative braking in snow or ice.

In all but two events, there were no other cars within 100 yards.   In the first 200 miles we had 2 minor braking events and one severe one (hard breaking that required steady accelerator pressure to regain and maintain speed). There were no events in the next 300 miles. Then we had a moderate event which I immediately corrected. The next event was the most severe -- rapid deceleration followed by acceleration then deceleration, then a few seconds of speed fluctuation before I took full control (I purposely allowed this event to play out without intervention since there was no one around us and I wanted to see if it would correct itself--it didn't). Unfortunately, my wife hurt her neck in this one which resulted in neck pain and headaches for the rest of the day. Our dogs were in the back seat and were tossed around but OK.  I then pulled over and rebooted the car. Within 5 minutes we had another moderate event. I pulled over again, cleaned the windshield, and reset/recalibrated the cameras. We understood this might take up to 100 miles, but in our case it only took about 5 miles. We tried the autopilot again and had a minor event within minutes and another minor event a few minutes later, and then a third a few minutes after that. I thought maybe the cameras didn't properly  recalibrate since the process was so fast, so I pulled over and recalibrated again. As before, recal was done in a few miles.

Since the side turn-signal is mounted right above the same blind-spot cameras, the light from the turn-signal often 'bleeds' into the camera feed used by the driver to determine if the appropriate lane is clear. At night, this causes the blind-spot camera video difficult to view since the video feed alternates between 'normal' video and a bright, flushed out video, matching the turn-signal timer. The end result is often times I, the driver having difficulty observing cars on the side of my vehicle at night. More specifically, several times I have missed the headlights of cars in the lane next to me because the turn signal light, bleeding into the camera feed, obscure or hides the car and/or headlights (since they driver's eyes have to chateaubriand adjust between a bright andrark video feed flashing).

Having now put roughly 6,000 miles on the vehicle in the conditions found in western Maryland/south-central Pennsylvania, I've been able to find these consistencies concerning phantom braking:  On an undivided 2-lane highway:   1. When it's a dashed line that allows for passing on long straight stretches, more phantom braking incidents occur than when the center line is double-solid. Those are usually 5-15mph braking events until the opposing vehicle has passed without incident.  2. When going down/up a gently sloping hill and the car is unable to see the lines far enough ahead because of a turn. If a vehicle is coming the opposite direction, the car appears to believe that the opposing vehicle is in your lane and coming right at your vehicle. These are usually the hardest phantom braking events.  3. When vehicles are parked parallel along the side of an undivided road, and especially at night, the car appears to think these are threats to its/my safety. I say that they appear worse at night, as when my headlights cause the rear taillights/reflectors to visually brighten, the incidents are more frequent.  These vary wildly, from having no braking events to hard braking events.  On a divided highway:  The most consistent issues in my case happen when going up/down mountains.  A highway turns into 3 lanes, with the rightmost lane for large, heavy trucks that are going slower than the rest of traffic. If you are in the middle lane, and that slow truck is using it's 4-way blinkers, Autopilot/TACC appears to see it as an emergency vehicle, and heavily brakes.

At noon on 10-24-21, I was testing the latest release of FSD as part of the beta program.   My Tesla was in self-driving mode on a city street at 35 mph. This was the same route it had already successfully done earlier in the day, when suddenly the car jumped over the curb, causing damage to the bumper, to the wheel and a flat tire. This appeared to have been caused by a discolored patch in the road that gave the FSD a false perception of an obstacle which it tried to avoid.  Immediately after the accident, the car was towed to the service center. The repair was finished on 10/27/21 at which time I was asked to pay $2,332.37 to take possession of the car. I explained that the damage was caused by the recalled version of FSD NHTSA recall number 21V-846 and that Tesla should be liable for the damages. I was advised that the engineering team would conduct an investigation and based on the results the money would be reimbursed.  However, I did not agree to pay hoping that after the investigation Tesla would honor the recall.  After two months of waiting, there is still no communication on the results of the investigation even though the case is quite simple.

I am writing to you about a safety concern I have that I think is significant:  Specifically, Tesla in THIS new model has changed the design of the sterring wheel and steering column controls.  My concern is that the turn signal activation is NO LONGER on a stalk but rather is located within the altered design of the stearing wheel which Tesla refers to as a YOKE.  The right/left turn signals are switches within the left side of the yoke wheel, they are non raised.  I find them extremely difficult to activate reliably, ESPECIALLY IF THE WHEEL IS IN ANY POSITION OTHER THAN HORIZONTAL.   YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD FREQUENTLY TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACTIVATED THE TURN SIGNAL AND THERE IS A RISK THAT THE WRONG DIRECTION WILL BE ACTIVATED.

I almost crashed today when I had to swerve to avoid a mother crossing the road with her child. I tapped on the honk, but unfortunately, it’s not in the middle of the steering wheel as one one would expect, but it’s a small touch button right next to the cruise control touch button. each time i need to engage it, I have to take my arms off the road and find this button. It’s very distracting, especially in emergency situations. The turn signals are also « touch » only and there’s no way to really know if you have them or not. When turning in a roundabout, the yoke steering wheel is almost upside down and trying to signal is nearly impossible.

After having used this system for some time, I believe it to be extremely dangerous and ill-advised.  First, Tesla eliminated the fixed-position directional stalk and moved directionals, wiper functions, high-beam functions and even the horn to small, poorly-defined ""buttons"" on the steering yoke.  This change makes variable what should be fixed positioning for very important vehicle functions.  In other words, these buttons become moving targets on an awkwardly-shaped spinning control surface that often requires the driver to take their eyes off the road in order to attempt even the most basic operations like signaling or using the horn.  This is *extremely* difficult and *extremely* dangerous.  For example, trying to signal when exiting a roundabout. In that maneuver, the yoke is nearly upside down and the buttons are backwards AND in the wrong hand.  Or, operating the horn in an emergency situation.  Rather than pressing the large center portion of a steering wheel, the driver must take their attention from the road in order to hunt for a small button in a random position on the yoke.  Less critical but still important, the yoke itself is problematic in that it provides a reduced and awkwardly-shaped control surface, especially at low speed and in emergency situations.",Vehicle,2021,TESLA,MODEL S

I find myself awkwardly trying to make simple 90 degree turns.  However, a more significant turn, such as a legal U turn, is altogether more dangerous.  First you must twist your arms upside down to execute the turn, or you need to rotate grips but the wheel is only designed to be gripped while straight/upright.  This causes a very real threat of missing your hold on the wheel.  Then as you try to controllably/slowly straighten the vehicle the steering wheel rips through your hands before you can complete the turn.  God forbid anyone attempts a hasty 3 point turn with a car approaching.  In addition, I am a six foot tall male and my knees actually come in contact with the wheel as the lower outside corners of the trapezoidal shape protrude down and out.  If I am gripping the outside of the wheel, at 9 and 3, my hands can also contact my knees.  This is with the wheel tilted/moved up to its highest position.  Then there's the turn signals which are much too easy to engage accidentally or engage incorrectly (touch left when you mean to touch right).  The roll wheel which controls radio volume and track fwd is mm from the turn signals which are activated simply by touch, not depressing a button, which means inadvertently activating them happens commonly.  To see if the turn signals are activated your eyes must find small blinking arrows at the bottom of Teslas 'videogame' display - what the car's cameras are detecting such as other cars, trucks, stop signs etc - the needlessly distracting display cannot be turned off.  All of this made worse on a temptingly fast car.  This wheel design is made for a track, not for consumer driving.  People will die from this design, all in the name of ""cool"".

The vehicle rapidly slows by +/- 5 mph, which made a couple of folks following me irritated as my car is slowing and brake lights are coming on for no reason.  I can decrease this reaction by the vehicle by steering the vehicle to far left side of my lane when passing the semi, but even then, it would still sometimes phantom brake.  This happened about 15-20 times during a 2000 mile trip.  This reaction by the vehicle, is decreasing safety, not increasing it.   2.  Same condition with the adaptive cruise control on (auto steering off), passing a semi that is in the lane immediately to the right, but this time the car rapidly slows itself when I am about 5 car lengths back of the truck. This is an unsafe problem and needs to be fixed asap.

The opening is for a single car, & has pillars on either side, allowing 8-9"", total, clearance with mirrors folded.  Even with mirrors extended, I have limited visibility to the clearance of the sides of the car, as they pass the pillars. The repeater cameras, in the front fenders, are a great support to see the garage as I back into my garage.  However, the UI, immediately upon selecting 'Reverse' while near the home garage, conceals 50% of these side images from view with a pop-up rectangular user interface (UI) -- ruining any advantage I have to see the rear as I pass these obstacles.  As a result, I have to dismiss the pop-up UI & avoid triggering the controls within it, by making a sliding motion on the center display, with my fingers applied to the UI. This is a problem because: 1) the UI displays the option to trigger one of my 3 garage doors, each of which have an associated homelink rectangular button. This is useless when the garage is already open. 2) I'm in reverse, so I'm trying to back-in to the garage in one motion.  Adding an extra steps, by clearing this obscuring UI distracts. 3) With tight clearances added problems are: trash might lie outside the garage; items can be left in my garage stall; people could be nearby.  Distractions mess this up. Tesla likely fails: a) that the garage could already be activated to be open (or even opening) -- & therefore, tends to prompt the user multiple times, while parking;  b) that 3 homelink garages are at the home. They didn't budget screen real-estate to show the homelink buttons without obscuring the backup display-screens assigned to each of the 3 rear-ward facing cameras; c) that a driver prefers to back-in to the parking space, relying on views of the 3 cameras to avoid obstacles.  Tesla counted on people to forward to park.",Vehicle,2022,TESLA,MODEL S

The sales associate told me that it's easy to get used to, and that it works well. I have driven the car for a couple weeks now and it is clearly a safety hazard. First off, it is difficult to steer, especially if you need to get out of a dangerous situation quickly. The yokes shape is extremely wide, and you have to reach hand over hand to turn. If you lose control on a icy road and need to keep the wheels facing in the direction that you wish to go, you will be unable to do so. Next, this yoke steering wheel has buttons for the horn and turn signals. I tried using my horn two days ago to tell someone in a parking lot that my car was close to theirs. I almost hit their car because the horn button was not working. Next, when I am steering, the turn signals and windshield wipers are accidentally triggered. This happens all the time. Furthermore, these issues do not make it safe to direct the vehicle under a high stress event. Having your windshield wipers triggered while trying to steer quickly is disorienting. It is only a matter of time till this steering wheel causes an accident on the roads.",Vehicle,2022,TESLA,MODEL S

In a traditional car, or even model 3/Y. Gear shift is intuitive, can be confirmed by visual, muscle memory, sometimes audible as well.  In the new Tesla model x/s, the shift happens on the side of the center screen. A thin but very long slide , going up from middle point vertically all the way goes to drive, going down to reverse.  The problem is, sitting in driver’s position with your elbow sweeping up and down , especially such a long sweep perfectly needs extra attention. And it needs to be vertical, which is hard to do since the natural elbow motion make your hand movement curved. But in order to get engaged with gear successfully it needs to be perfectly straight.   The worst part is, there is no redundancy to confirm your gear engagement except visual — by confirming a tiny text showing gear , on a different screen(cluster) , sometimes laggy response .   While the traditional gear shift that people used to can be done by muscle memory , then confirmed by touch/feel, like crisp stalk click or shifter lever steady stuck in new gear , and audibles. You can always confirm by visual as well but it’s not always the case.  This makes back and forth maneuvers in a time critical situation ( like parking parallels in a busy street) more stressful and much more room for fail to engage the gear you want.  I had an minor incident due to fail to shift to drive , stuck at reverse then hit a parked vehicle in a parking lot at a low speed.   Had I been in a traditional car, this kind of mis-shift would never happen, I had been driving for over a decade and never had a collision before, this is the first time. not to mention such a ‘stupid mistKe’  This design is unsafe for seasoned drivers, and needs to be improved.",Vehicle,2022,TESLA,MODEL X
